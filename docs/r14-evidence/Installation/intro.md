# Getting Started

## Downloading r14-evidence

![The cfx keymaster website](/img/keymaster.png)

After purchasing r14-evidence from our tebex store, you'll need to navigate to your FiveM Keymaster in order to access
and download your resource. You will find it under **Granted Assets** and should download a ```.zip``` file containing
a main r14-evidence folder.

## Unzipping r14-evidence

![Our downlaoded zip file](/img/archive.png)

We will need to use an archive utility such as [WinRAR](https://win-rar.com/) to open our ```.zip``` file. Inside you 
will find the resource itself, some readme files, our inventory images, and a file we need to update in our 
```qb-smallresources/client/``` folder. Once we have our files ready to push to our server, we can use your file transfer
program of your choice to begin the installation process.

## Installing r14-evidence

![Place your r14-evidence resource folder into your resource list](/img/installresource.png)

We will want to begin our install by adding the r14-evidence subfolder to our server resource list, either by adding it
into our resource folder and ensuring it via the ```server.cfg``` file or by placing it into an ensured directory. Once
we have done this, we will want to navigate to our inventory resource to begin making the necessary modifications for
r14-evidence.
