## Evidence Bag Functionality

Evidence bags are now able to be used by players in order to acesss the evidence bag menu introduced in
r14-evidence. This menu allows players to copy key pieces of information from the evidence bag without needing
to try and select an inventory tooltip to do so, as well as being able to create and edit notes to describe the
evidence bag.

## Target Integration

Most police actions have now been made fully accessible via qb-target interactions for police characters, allowing 
players to more easily investigate the person they are trying to, and removing the need to 'step aside' to use commands
or radial menu actions that just get the closest player. Now players can quickly and accurately target other players 
and select an action from the list of target options. Currently, the script allows police to use the Investigate Person
(replaces Check Status), GSR Test, Frisk, Collect DNA, Breathalyze, and Drug Test on other players.

## Chat Records

As a small quality-of-life improvement for police roleplayers, most investgiations and actions taken by players will
return their results as chat messages rather than simply as notifications. This allows players to more easily screenshot
important information, and reducing the need of players to take notes using out of city resources or requiring the
need to record their gameplay to remember important details, letting cops focus on roleplaying rather than notetaking!
